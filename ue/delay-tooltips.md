# Delaying editor tooltips

Sometimes the annoying pesky tooltips appear too often when you don't want to see them. Delay their appearance by using this command:

`Slate.TolltipSummonDelay X`

Where X is number of seconds to wait after the mouse cursor has landed on something before tooltip is shown.
